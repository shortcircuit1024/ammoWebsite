            <p>AMMO was born from the ashes of Orion Terra-systems, a corporation based on Armitage that helped to prepare the planet for the large-scale agriculture it was becoming known for. At that time, the first elements of the org were part of the corporation’s Mobile Militia Division – essentially a security force whose main focus was protecting the company’s facilities and headquarters on Armitage and its interests in the system as a whole. When the Vanduul were first recognized as a true threat rather than just another group of pirate raiders, Orion Terra-systems’ leadership made an unusual decision – the Final Order. Rather than evacuate to protect corporate assets and profits, they asked all able personnel to hold fast, protecting the escaping farmers and other civilians. The Mobile Militia Division made up a significant portion of the “civilian” ships that stood alongside the Peacekeeper Security forces in the desperate defense of the planet that helped to save the lives of the last evacuees of the planet.</p>
            <p>In the chaos of the aftermath, it became clear to the Mobile Militia’s surviving commanders that Orion Terra-Systems, as a company, had not survived. They were a corporate security division without a corporation to secure. Understanding the sacrifice that had been made, however, most of the surviving commanders chose to continue the mission they were given – to protect civilian refugees from Armitage, and give them the means to escape to nearby systems that were, as of yet, not threatened by the Vanduul. Gradually the disparate ship captains and squadrons assembled at their old rendezvous points near the edge of the Caliban system. The Mobile Militia used surviving corporate freighters as impromptu supply depots, hospitals, and even temporary shelters for refugees as they arranged passage on transport ships bound for safer places in the galaxy.</p>
            <p>The Mobile Militia’s errant forces rallied around the Final Order, taking their role as refugee protectors to heart. As the flow of refugees trickled to a halt and Vanduul sorties pressed closer and closer, they had still not officially recognized that they were no longer a part of a corporation. That only came with the decision of the commanders to abandon their rendezvous point for a more permanent base of operations, in the face of a large Vanduul raid seemingly targeting them specifically. Daring Mobile Militia captains led the raiders on a twisting chase between the Caliban system’s many jump points, while affiliated freighters and other civilian ships made their escape. When the surviving diversion force’s ships arrived in Oberon, it marked their first real “victory” against the enemy, as well as the first official operation of the Armitage Mobile Militia Offensive.</p>
            <p>In the years and decades that followed, AMMO developed into something similar to the independent organizations of the modern UEE – They followed the military structure of their organization, but increasingly blended in trade and other non-combat roles, at first to provide logistics and later to earn the credits that kept the fleet flying. AMMO fighters flew escort for independent traders and small-scale company fleets. AMMO haulers moved goods between dozens of independent and UEE worlds along the edge of increasingly tense borders. The Final Order was never forgotten, though – Orion survivors and their descendants, often part of the other vast networks of pilots and captains, knew they could always trust their AMMO comrades.</p>
